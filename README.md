## UX

### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

La Petite Traveller's target users are:
* Aged 18-60
* People interested in travelling
* Have an interest in visiting South Italy

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear, concise, easy-to-find information
* Beautiful photos that provide inspiration and make the destinations look desirable
* Recommendations about typical food

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. An effort was taken to not provide an overwhelming amount of information at first glance as this is often the reason people are put off with travel guides.

### **Scope**

In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

- Header and menu bar, to navigate to various sections of the page
- Brief introduction about meaning of Salento, which is not a real region
- Information about Mediterranean climate and seasons
- Some tips about local food
- List of place to visit primarily
- Gallery of images from my last trip in Salento
- Newsletter sign up form
- Links to affiliate social media pages

### **Structure** 

This is a single-page website to allow for desired flow; the navigation bar at the top allows for users to easily move to whatever section of the site they are interested in or they can simply scroll through the information as it is displayed.
I chose the following order for the information 'Home > Salento Life > Must See > Contact Me', as I felt this would allow the information to be digested in the best way. There is a concise review of Salento at the beginning before providing some information about the local weather and food. After this, a gallery of pictures is provided to inspire future traveler and encourage old traveler to come back. The last section is a simple sign up form for users to sign up to the Salentu, Sule, Mare e Ientu newsletter.

### **Surface**

I chose a colour palette based around dark orange because this is a warm color and it reminds me of the warm temperature of Salento.
I want this to be helpful for the users to have a sense of what they will get travelling in a warm place like Salento.

3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to work on

*Cloning the GitHub Repository*

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning can also be a great way to backup your work.

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. Press the arrow on the Code button
